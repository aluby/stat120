title: "Exam I Corrections"
---

I offer exam corrections for two reasons: 

 1. To correct any major misunderstandings and have a chance to revisit material that you struggled with
 2. To mitigate the impact that a bad exam day can have on your course grade
 
You can submit corrections to your exam to earn back 50% of your missed points. Corrected exam grades are capped at **86%**. (If you scored above or near this number, you did great! Neither point (1) or (2) applies to you)

If you'd like to submit corrections, include the following for each question that you would like to resubmit: 

 (a) Your original answer
 (b) Your corrected answer (should _not_ be the same as any feedback provided on your graded exam)
 (c) An example/practice problem from homework, daily prep, notes, or the book that a future student could study to understand the exam problem.

You should submit a corrected exam **on paper** at the beginning of class one week from today
