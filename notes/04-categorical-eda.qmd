# Categorical Variables

Categorical variables are best summarized with a **frequency table** and visualized using a **barplot**. When we want to summarize a categorical variable with a single number, we often use a **proportion**.

::: callout-note
Proportion \vspace{.5in}

When we have two categorical variables, we often use a **two-way table** to summarize them at the same time (also called the **joint distribution**). We might also care about the **marginal distribution** (the margins) or **conditional distribution** (a specific row/column).

**Example:** Below is the two-way table for our class representing the answers to "Have you taken a CS class before?" and whether the "Environmental Issues" interest box was checked.

|                       | Week 1 | Week 7 |
|-----------------------|--------|--------|
| Yes (Got Sleep)       | 10     | 4      |
| No (Not enough sleep) | 6      | 9      |

a. What is the marginal distribution of *Sleep*? 
\vspace{.5in}
b. What is the conditional distribution of *Week* among those who *did not get enough sleep*?
\vspace{.5in}
c. What is the conditional distribution of *Sleep* among those who *were surveyed in Week 1*? 
\vspace{.5in}
d. What is the proportion of students who were surveyed in Week 1?
\vspace{.5in}
e. Does *sleep* appear to be independent of *week*? 


# Quantitative Variables

Quantitative variables are best visualized with a **histogram** or **dotplot** (depending on sample size)

\vspace{1in}

When describing quantitative variables, we typically care most about the **shape** and **center**. When we want to summarize a quantitative variable with a single number, we often choose the **mean**, **median**, or **mode**.

+---------------------------+------------------------+--------------------------+
| Skewed Right \hspace{1in} | Symmetric \hspace{1in} | Skewed Left \hspace{1in} |
+===========================+========================+==========================+
| \vspace{1.5in}            |                        |                          |
|                           |                        |                          |
| .                         |                        |                          |
+---------------------------+------------------------+--------------------------+

There are various ways to describe the center of the distribution. The three most common are:
