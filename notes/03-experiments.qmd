# Experimental Design Principles

1. **Control** aspects of the experiment that we know may have an impact on the response, but are not the factors being studied
2. **Randomize** subjects to treatments to even out effects that we cannot control
3. **Replicate** over many subjects, or perhaps a different group of subjects

There are lots of different ways to design experiments following the **randomize** and **replicate** approach. Two that we'll see on in this class are:
