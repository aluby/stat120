1. Experiments vs Observational Studies
2. Communicating Conclusions


## Observational Studies

. . . 

*Researchers studying the relationship between exercising and energy levels asked participants in their study how  many times a week they exercise and whether they have high or low energy when they wake up in the morning.*

. . . 

*Based on repsonses to the exercise question, the researchers grouped people into three categories: no exercise, exercise 1-3 times per week, and exercise more than 3 times per week*

. . . 

*The researchers then compared the proportions of people who said they have high energy in the mornings across the three exercise categories*. 

. . . 

This is an **observational study** since the researchers had no control over how often people exercised. 

. . . 

Results *could* be due to exercise habits, or it could be do to something else.

. . . 

The most we can say is that *morning energy* and *exercise habits* are **related to each other**. 

## Let's change it up: 

. . . 

*Researchers studying the relationship between exercising and energy levels randomly assigned participants in their study into three groups: no exercise, exercise 1-3 times per week, and exercise more than 3 times per week*

. . . 

*After one week, participants were asked whether they have high or low energy when they wake up in the morning.*

. . . 

*The researchers then compared the proportions of people who said they have high energy in the mornings across the three exercise categories*. 

. . . 

In this case, researchers have **randomly assigned** participants to groups: we know that any differences are not due to other underlying attributes. 

. . . 

This means we can say that *more exercise* **causes** better *morning energy levels*.

## Experiments 

- Explanatory Variable is **manipulated** by researchers
- Random Assignment (usually)
- Response Variable is measured
- With random assignment, any differences in the response variable between the groups is *caused* by the change in the explanatory variable
- Without random assignment, we have to be mindful of *confounding/lurking variables*


## Confounding and Lurking Variables

In an **observational study**, **lurking variables** are other variables that may cause any association that we observe

. . . 

In an **experiment**, **confounding variables** are other variables that are related to our explanatory variable that may be causing the difference in our response variable. (for example, if different groups participate in our exercise study at different times of the year, the weather or daylight may be impacting our results)

. . . 

In this class, we'll use these terms interchangeably. **Random assignment** of the explanatory variable should "take care" of any confounding variables.

## What types of conclusions can we draw?



|                    | Random Assignment                                | No Random Assignment                                                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Random Sampling**    | Causal conclusion, generalized to the population | No causal conclusion (only correlation), generalized to the population        |
| **No Random Sampling** | Causal conclusion for the sample                 | No causal conclusion (only correlation), no generalization to the population  |

. . . 

When we have random assignment (an experiment), correlation __does__ equal causation. 

. . . 

When we have a random sample, we **can** generalize to the population

## You should be comfortable answering the following questions about a study design: 

(a) Whether it was an observational study or experiment

. . . 

**if it was an observational study, identify:**

(b) the subjects studied and how they were selected

(c) the parameter of interest

(d) the nature and scope of the conclusion the study can reach


. . . 

**if it was an experiment, identify:**

(b) the subjects studied 

(c) the explanatory variable(s) in the experiment

(d) the response variable measured

(e) the nature and scope of the conclusion the experiment can reach

## Example: Swedish Study {.smaller}

> *Epidemiology is the study of how and why diseases occur in the population, and Scandinavian countries are an epidemiologist's dream. This is because everyone in those countries has a personal identification number which is used when registering for health care, education, tax, and so on, and this allows researchers to link all these different aspects of people's lives together in a way that would be impossible (and perhaps politically controversal) in other countries.* -David Spiegelhalter, *The Art of Statistics*, Ch 4

. . . 

Let's look at one Scandinavian epidemiology study:

Khanolkar AR, Ljung R, Talback M, et al. Socioeconomic position and the risk of brain tumour: a Swedish national population-based cohort study *J Epidemiol Community Health* 2016;70:1222-1228. [link](https://jech.bmj.com/content/70/12/1222)

## {.scrollable .smaller}

**Background** The aim was to investigate associations between different measures of socioeconomic position (SEP) and incidence of brain tumours (glioma, meningioma and acoustic neuroma) in a nationwide population-based cohort.

. . . 

**Methods** We included 4,305,265 individuals born in Sweden during 1911-1961, and residing in Sweden in 1991. Cohort members were followed from 1993 to 2010 for a first primary diagnosis of brain tumour identified from the National Cancer Register. Poisson regression was used to compute incidence rate ratios (IRR) by highest education achieved, family income, occupational group and marital status, with adjustment for age, healthcare region of residence, and time period.

. . . 


**Results** We identified 5735 brain tumours among men and 7101 among women during the study period. Highly educated men ( $\ge3$ years university education) had increased risk of glioma (IRR 1.22, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.37) compared to men with primary education. High income was associated with higher incidence of glioma in men (1.14, 1.01 to 1.27). Women with $\ge3$ years university education had increased risk of glioma (1.23, 1.08 to 1.40) and meningioma (1.16, 1.04 to 1.29) compared to those with primary education. Men and women in intermediate and higher non-manual occupations had increased risk of glioma compared to low manual groups. Compared to those married/cohabiting, being single or previously married/cohabiting was associated with decreased risk of glioma in men. Men in non-manual occupations had ~50% increased risk of acoustic neuroma compared to men in low manual occupations.

. . . 

**Conclusions** We observed consistent associations between higher SEP and higher risk of glioma. Completeness of cancer registration and detection bias are potential explanations for the findings.


#

This is an **observational study** and the main finding was that there were **consistent associations between higher socioeconomic position and incidence of brain tumors**. 

. . . 

 This is a perfectly fine study with perfectly fine statistical conclusions drawn from the data.
