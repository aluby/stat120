## What makes you nervous about this class?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
survey = read_csv("../data/survey_anon.csv")
survey$stats = survey$`Have you taken a statistics course before?`

## Have you taken a stats class before?

```{r}
survey %>%

## How familiar are you with the following tools? 

```{r}
survey %>% 
  select(`How familiar are you with the following tools: [R]`, 
         `How familiar are you with the following tools: [RMarkdown]`,

# Meet your groups! {.maize}

# In your groups: 

1. Try to figure out what shared interest you all listed in the survey
2. Complete the academic honesty and group expectations worksheet

# Data Recap {.maize}

# Samples and Populations {.maize}

## Consider the following research questions: 

1. What is the average mercury content of swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean? 
2. Over the last five years, what is the average time to complete a degree for undergraduates in Minnesota? How does it compare to other states?
3. Does a new drug reduce the heart attack rate in patients with severe heart disease? 

## 3 Possible Responses: 

1. A man on the news got mercury poisoning from eating swordfish, so it must be dangerously high. 
2. I met two students who took less than 4 years to graduate, so it must take less time to graduate in Minnesota than in other states.
3. My friend's father had a heart attack after taking the new drug for six months, so it must not work

## The big picture

The ultimate goal of statistics is to learn about a population using a subset of that population. But, populations are *hard* (sometimes impossible!) to measure. 

## Spectrum of Samples

## Definitions

::: callout-note
## Population

Includes all units of interest

## Sample

Subset of the population

## Parameters and Statistics

*Parameters* are quantities that describe the population (like a mean). *Statistics* are corresponding quantities that describe a sample.

# Examples

## Identify the **sample mean** and (claimed) **population mean**

American households spent an average of about \$52 in 2007 on Halloween merchandise such as costumes, decorations, and candy. To see if this number had changed, researchers conducted a new survey in 2008 before industry numbers were reported. The survey included 1,500 households and found that average Halloween spending was \$58 per household.

The average GPA of students in 2001 at a private university was 3.37. A survey on a sample of 203 students from this university yielded an average GPA of 3.59 a decade later.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out}
A recent article in a college newspaper stated that college students get an average of 5.5 hours of sleep each night. A student who was skeptical about this value decided to conduct a survey by randomly sampling 25 students. On average, the sampled students slept 6.25 hours per night

## What's wrong?

I'm interested in how satisfied the Carleton community is with the fitness center. I decide I need a sample size of 100, so at 6am one morning, I stand outside the entrance ask the first 100 people who exit whether or not they enjoyed their workout. They all said yes, so I conclude the fitness center is a perfect facility.

## What's wrong?

75% of online reviews for a product are negative, so 75% of buyers are dissatisfied with the product. 

## 

::: callout-note
## Simple Random Sample

All groups of size $n$ have an equal chance of being selected
:::

::: callout-note
## Bias

Occurs when the method of collecting data causes the sample to inaccurately represent the population
:::

## 

::: callout-note
## Undercoverage

Part of the population has less representation in the sample
:::

::: callout-note
## Voluntary Response

Individuals choose whether or not to participate
:::

::: callout-note
## Convenience Sample

Sample consists of units that are "easy" to sample
:::

::: callout-note
## Non-response bias

Large fraction of the selected sample do not respond/participate
