## CLT recap

If the sample size is big enough and the sample is random, 

$$\bar{X} \sim N(\mu, SE_\bar{X})$$

$$\widehat{p} \sim N(p, SE_\widehat{p})$$ 

. . . 

And we can build a confidence interval with the formula: 

$$\text{Sample Stat} \pm z^* \times SE$$

. . . 

Where $z^*$ is determined by the confidence level that we want

## Recap: Q2 (d) from last class: 

The table below gives some of the percentiles of the N(0,1)
    distribution. If you were given this table (for example on an exam,
    where you do not have access to R), what could you say about the
    value of the p-value? (The z-score was 2.917)
    
|  percentage  |  percentile (`qnorm(percentage)`)  |
|:---------------------:|:------------:|
|         90%          |     1.3      |
|         95%          |     1.6      |
|         97.5%          |     2.0      |
|         99%          |     2.3      |
|         99.5%          |     2.6      |

## `qnorm(.9) = 1.28`

```{r}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = seq(-4,4,by=.1)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks= -3:3) + 
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, fill = "#ED7953FF", xlim = c(-5, 1.28)) +
  annotate("text", x = -3, y = .1, label = "90%", col = "#ED7953FF", size = 16) + 
  annotate("text", x = 3, y = .1, label = "10%", col = "gray30", size = 16) 
```

. . . 

If z-score is bigger than 1.28, p-value is smaller than .1

## `qnorm(.995) = 2.6`

```{r}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = seq(-4,4,by=.1)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks= -3:3) + 
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, fill = "#ED7953FF", xlim = c(-5, 2.6)) +
  annotate("text", x = -3, y = .1, label = "99.5%", col = "#ED7953FF", size = 16) + 
  annotate("text", x = 3, y = .1, label = "0.5%", col = "gray30", size = 16) 
```

. . . 

If z-score is bigger than 2.6, p-value is smaller than 0.005

## If we are making a (1-$\alpha$) confidence interval, want $\alpha/2$ on either side

### `qnorm(.975) = 2.0` and `qnorm(.025) = -2.0`

```{r}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = seq(-4,4,by=.1)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks= -3:3) + 
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, fill = "#ED7953FF", xlim = c(-2, 2)) +
  annotate("text", x = -3, y = .1, label = "2.5%", col = "gray30", size = 16) + 
  annotate("text", x = 3, y = .1, label = "2.5%", col = "gray30", size = 16)
```


## Today: means

- How big of a sample is "big enough"? 
- How do we get SE? 


## How big is "big enough"? 

Rule of thumb for means: 

 $$n \ge 30$$


## How do we find SE?

$$SE_{\bar{X}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

where $\sigma$ is standard deviation of the data

. . . 

Idea: as $n$ gets bigger, the SE gets smaller. If standard deviation is small, the SE is also small 

## Florida Lakes Example 

::: .nonincremental

- 53 lakes in Florida were randomly sampled. 
- In each lake, a sample of fish was taken and their mercury level was measured. The maximum mercury level for each lake was recorded. 
- If mercury concentration is $<1$ ppm, then the fish is safe to eat. 
- Is the average *maximum* mercury content in Florida lakes safe to eat?
:::

## MaxMercury content in Florida Lakes
### $\bar{X} = `r round(mean(Lock5Data::FloridaLakes$MaxMercury),2)`$ and $s = `r round(sd(Lock5Data::FloridaLakes$MaxMercury), 2)`$. 

```{r}
Lock5Data::FloridaLakes %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = MaxMercury)) + 
  geom_histogram(col = "white", bins = 20)
```

Is it safe to use the CLT?

## Florida Lakes Example

Hypotheses: 

  $H_0: \mu = 1$
  
  $H_A: \mu < 1$

. . . 

Sample Statistic: $\bar{X} = `r round(mean(Lock5Data::FloridaLakes$MaxMercury),2)`$ and $s = `r round(sd(Lock5Data::FloridaLakes$MaxMercury), 2)`$

. . . 

If $H_0$ is true, 

$$ z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{SE} \sim N(0,1)$$

## 

Test Statistic: 

$$ z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{SE} = \frac{\bar{X} - 1}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{.87 - 1}{\frac{.52}{\sqrt{53}}} = -1.75$$

. . . 

If the true average max mercury measurement was 1, the sample average we observed was 1.75 standard errors smaller than expected 

. . . 

P-value: 

```{r}
#| echo: true 

pnorm(-1.75)
```

. . . 

We reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_A$, and conclude we have strong evidence that the mean max mercury content in all Florida lakes is <1 ppm. (but I am still not going to eat the fish)

## Example 2: Guinness beer acidity 

```{r}
guinness = tibble(
  acidity = c(3.9, 4.1, 4.4, 4.3, 3.8)
)
```

Different soil properties, ingredient levels, and fermentation methods can produce different levels of acidity when brewing beer. Guinness beer typically has a pH level of 4.3. The company is testing a new fermentation method that will speed up the brewing process, but want to make sure that the acidity doesn't increase using the new method. (*Note:* lower pH = higher acidity)

. . . 

Five batches were tested with the new fermentation method. The average acidity was `r round(mean(guinness$acidity), 2)` and the sd was `r round(sd(guinness$acidity), 2)`

. . . 

```{r}
#| echo: true

n = 5
xbar = 4.1
sd = 0.25
se = sd/sqrt(n)
z = (xbar - 4.3)/se
z
pnorm(z)
```


## William Sealy Gosset (1876-1937) 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="68%" .nonincremental}
- This actually happened! Gosset was the head experimental brewer for Guinness but had a stats-y streak
- After lots of experiments with small sample sizes, he realized he was getting way more significant results than he "should" have
- In 1906, Guinness sent him to UCL to work with Karl Pearson, a well-known statistician 
- He proved that, in small sample sizes, the test statistic we just used isn't actually normally distributed

## Normal distribution vs Actual $n=5$ test statistic

```{r}
tibble(
  x = seq(-4,4,length.out = 1000),
  normal = dnorm(x),
  `n=5` = dt(x, df = 4)
) |>
  pivot_longer(-x, names_to = "distribution", values_to = "density") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = density, col = distribution, linetype = (distribution == "normal"))) + 
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#CC4678FF", "black")) +
  guides(linetype = FALSE) + 
  labs(
    col = ""
  ) + 
  theme(legend.position = "top") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = -1.78, col = "darkorange", linewidth = 1.5)
```

Will the p-value for the actual n=5 distribution be *smaller* or *larger* than the p-value with the normal distribution?

## Actual p-value (with n=5 distribution)

```{r}
#| echo: true

n = 5
xbar = 4.1
sd = 0.25
se = sd/sqrt(n)
t = (xbar - 4.3)/se
t
pt(t, df = n-1)
```

## The t-distribution

```{r}
tibble(
  x = seq(-4,4,length.out = 1000),
  normal = dnorm(x),
  `df=1` = dt(x, df = 1),
  `df=3` = dt(x, df = 3),
  `df=10` = dt(x, df = 10),
  `df=30` = dt(x, df = 30)
) |>
  pivot_longer(-x, names_to = "distribution", values_to = "density") |>
  mutate(distribution = factor(distribution,
                               levels = c("normal", "df=1", "df=3", "df=10", "df=30"))) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = density, col = distribution, linetype = (distribution == "normal"))) + 
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("black", viridis::viridis(4, end = .75, option = "plasma", direction = -1))) +
  guides(linetype = FALSE) + 
  labs(
    col = ""
  ) + 
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

## The t-distribution

- When we divide by the *estimated* SE ($\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$) instead of $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$, the test stat has a t-distribution instead of a N(0,1)
- The t-distribution depends on the "degrees of freedom" ($n-1$)
- When $df$ is small, t-distribution has "heavier tails" than N(0,1)
- When $df$ is large, the t-distribution is approximately equal to N(0,1)


## Florida Lakes (again)

$$t_{52} = \frac{.87 - 1}{\frac{.52}{\sqrt{53}}} = -1.75$$

```{r}
#| echo: true

t = -1.75
pnorm(t)
pt(t, df = 52)
```

::: {.nonincremental}
- Since the sample size is "big", the p-value using the Z distribution isn't much different than the "correct" value using the $t_{52}$ distribution
- Still better to do the correct thing
:::

## Summary

- Test stat for means: $t_{n-1} = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{SE}$
- SE: $\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$
- Can "safely" use CLT for means if $n \ge 30$
- If $n \le 30$, we can still use CLT if there are no outliers or extreme skew (but you should still be skeptical!)
- t-distribution is more correct, but for large sample sizes it shouldn't matter too much
- Percentage/probability of t-distribution below $t$-score: `pt(t-score, df = n-1)`
- Percentile $t^*$ value for a specific percentage: `qt(percentage, df = n-1)`
