The chunk of code below filters the data to only include values where age is greater or equal to 18 and less than or equal to 99 and then spits out how many cases are in the filtered dataset. These are the minimum and maximum values, so the entire dataset is included. Edit this chunk so it corresponds to your interval values above.

We also often want summary statistics per group. The code below groups the data by values, and then computes the mean and median for each group. Add a line of code to compute the sd() for each group.

Compute the mean,median, and sd of the Pay variable and describe the distribution. (You should focus on the shape, center, and spread.).\n3. You should have noted that the distribution is right-skewed (it has a long right tail). The code below demonstrates one way to remove outliers by filtering the very large observations and saving it to a new dataset called ceo_salaries_outliers. Run the code below, and then view the new dataset. Which companies have the highest CEO pay?\n\nceo_salaries_outliers &lt;- ceo_salaries %&gt;%\n  filter(Pay &gt; 100000000) \n\n4. Next, create a dataset called ceo_salaries_filtered that includes all cases where Pay is less than $100,000,000. Create a histogram of the Pay variable for this filtered dataset and compute the mean and median.\n5. Alternatively, we can visualize and work with a transformation of our dataset. This is especially useful when we have a “long-tailed” dataset. Explain what the next few lines of code do.\n\nceo_salaries = ceo_salaries %&gt;%\n  mutate(log_pay = log(Pay + 1))\n\nceo_salaries %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean = mean(log_pay),\n            median = median(log_pay))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n   mean median\n  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  16.4   16.6\n\n\n6. Create a histogram of the log_pay variable and describe the shape of the distribution.\n7. Your answer to 6 should note that there’s now low outlier(s)! Find these outlier(s). Which companies are they? What do they pay their CEOs? (Note: you should do this using code, but can check your answer with the “spreadsheet view” of the data.)\nWhen you’re done, please knit and save your file.",

Click “Show data table”.\n\nWhat is each case?\nWhat is each variable?\nDo you think this dataset represents a population or a sample?\nClose the dataset viewer. Click “Generate 10 samples”. What does each dot represent?\nWhat happens to the shape, center, and spread of the sampling distribution as n increases? (You can use “Generate 1000 samples” to speed this up)\nIs there a number of samples where the distribution doesn’t change much?\n\n2. Use StatKey’s proportion menu: https://www.lock5stat.com/StatKey/sampling_1_cat/sampling_1_cat.html to answer the following. (a) Click the “edit proportion” button to change the population parameter p\n\nChoose a value of p that is between .2 and .8.

About 10% of the worldwide population is left-handed. A 200-seat lecture hall has been built with 15 rows (the number of seats in each row varies). Each row has a single “lefty seat” that has the built-in desk on the left rather than the right arm of the chair. In a class of 90 students, what’s the probability that there will not be enough seats for the left-handed students?\n\nWhat number of left-handed students would have to be in the class for there to not be enough desks?\nSet up the sampling distribution using StatKey. What is p and n?\nSimulate 1000 samples. Use the results to estimate the probability.\nNow suppose there’s a class of 50 instead. Do you think this probability will be higher, lower, or about the same as (d)?\nUse StatKey to estimate the probability in (d). Are you surprised?\n\n4. Explain the difference between (1) the distribution of a population, (2) the distribution of a sample, (3) the sampling distribution.

I am always happy to fix these mistakes, and gradescope makes it easy to do so.\nRegrade requests must be submitted on gradescope within two weekdays after homework has been returned to you.\nRegrade requests are for administrative errors or obvious grading mistakes. I will not consider regrade requests for anything that applied to the entire class (e.g. “I think this mistake should only be worth 1 point instead of 2” or “I didn’t realize we had to do X”).\nIf you submit two or more inappropriate regrade requests, I will not consider additional regrade requests from you for the remainder of the term.\nIf you’re unsure whether you should file a regrade request or not, just ask! You are always welcome to discuss any grading questions with me in office hours.",

    "text": "Advice from past intro stat students:\n\nDon’t be afraid to ask questions. Even if you think they’re really stupid, asking them could help you understand so many concepts.\nEven if homework is due weekly, try to do it throughout the week so you can check your understanding between class periods. Ask Amanda for help - especially in R! It’s usually a quick fix and much easier than breaking your brain over a small error.\nDo the work! The class really is not too difficult if you do what Amanda assigns/recommends. Readings, daily preps, HWs were all very helpful for learning.\nTo keep up with the work and really nail down the concepts because everything connects and if you don’t understand something in the moment it will make things harder in the future\nDon’t be afraid to ask questions, in and out of class, and don’t try to figure everything out on your own. Talking through problems with friends, people from stats lab, or Amanda helps a lot!\nDo NOT procrastinate on the homework because a lot of times I had trouble knitting and that is not ideal if you wait until the last minute to turn in the homework.\nSTART. THE HOMEWORK. EARLY. You may think “oh, it’s a 100 level course, the homework can’t take THAT long” but it can. It CAN take that long. And it will.\nAsk questions! Prof. Luby is extremely helpful and approachable\ni would say to not be afraid of using R. it really isnt as bad as it looks and can be pretty fun to use if you just learn the fundamentals of it",

Appointment slots open 5 days in advance and close 2 hours in advance. Please use these for in-depth conversations about grade concerns, project consultations, or if you need extra help on a specific concept. You’re welcome to come as a group, but please note that 15 minutes goes by fast!\n\n\nStat Lab is staffed by friendly and knowledgeable student assistants who can help you with R questions that arise on your homework or projects. Please come prepared with your attempt, your class notes, and your lab manual to make the most of your time.\n\n\nSlack is an asychronous communication platform where you can also ask homework questions anytime! I’ll respond to messages at least twice per weekday. If you see someone ask a question that you know the answer to, please respond!",

    "text": "The “Genius Myth”\nIt’s sometimes easy to buy into the “genius myth” when it comes to math/stat courses: that you need to be a “math person” and have some innate mathematical ability in order to do well or become a statistics major. This could not be further from the truth! The best statisticians don’t necessarily have the “best” math or programming background, but are people that are able to formulate interesting questions and use math and programming to rigorously answer those questions. Many of the best statisticians I know became statisticians because they were initially interested in something else (biology, public health, psychology, neuroscience, physics, etc.) and realized that being able to answer important questions with data was not only valuable but fun and interesting. Being able to perform interesting statistical analyses is a skill that is learned, not an innate ability, and working hard at developing that skill is the point of this course.",

I encourage you to discuss the homework problems with others and use the resources available to you to try to figure out tough problems. You should code and write up your solutions on your own. Exams must be done by yourself without communicating with others; all work must be your own. The use of textbook solution manuals (physical or online), course materials from other students, or materials from previous versions of this course are not allowed. Copying, paraphrasing, summarizing, or submitting work generated by anyone but yourself without proper attribution is considered academic dishonesty (this includes output from LLMs).\nPlease ask if you are unsure of whether or not your actions are complying with the assignment/exam/project instructions. Always default to acknowledging any help received. Cases of suspected academic dishonesty are handled by the Provost’s Office and I am obligated to report any suspected violations of this policy.",

    "text": "Example 3.3: Is there a “Sprinting Gene”?\nA gene called ACTN3 encodes a protein which functions in fast-twitch muscles. Some people have a variant of this gene that cannot yield this protein. To address the question of whether this gene is associated with sprinting ability, geneticists tested people from three different groups: world-class sprinters, world-class marathon runners, and a control group of non-athletes. In the sames tested, 6% of the sprinters had the gene variant, compared with 18% of non-athletes and 24% of the marathon runners.",

    "text": "Background The aim was to investigate associations between different measures of socioeconomic position (SEP) and incidence of brain tumours (glioma, meningioma and acoustic neuroma) in a nationwide population-based cohort.\n\nMethods We included 4,305,265 individuals born in Sweden during 1911-1961, and residing in Sweden in 1991. Cohort members were followed from 1993 to 2010 for a first primary diagnosis of brain tumour identified from the National Cancer Register. Poisson regression was used to compute incidence rate ratios (IRR) by highest education achieved, family income, occupational group and marital status, with adjustment for age, healthcare region of residence, and time period.\n\n\nResults We identified 5735 brain tumours among men and 7101 among women during the study period. Highly educated men ( \\(\\ge3\\) years university education) had increased risk of glioma (IRR 1.22, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.37) compared to men with primary education. High income was associated with higher incidence of glioma in men (1.14, 1.01 to 1.27). Women with \\(\\ge3\\) years university education had increased risk of glioma (1.23, 1.08 to 1.40) and meningioma (1.16, 1.04 to 1.29) compared to those with primary education. Men and women in intermediate and higher non-manual occupations had increased risk of glioma compared to low manual groups. Compared to those married/cohabiting, being single or previously married/cohabiting was associated with decreased risk of glioma in men. Men in non-manual occupations had ~50% increased risk of acoustic neuroma compared to men in low manual occupations.\n\n\nConclusions We observed consistent associations between higher SEP and higher risk of glioma. Completeness of cancer registration and detection bias are potential explanations for the findings.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "These problems are drawn from the textbook with the datasets built into StatKey. I want the focus today to be on the “big ideas” of bootstrap distributions and confidence intervals, without the added complexity of coding. Next time, we’ll see how to load data and create bootstrap confidence intervals in R.\n\n\n\nPart of what you need to do is choose the right menu within StatKey. For example, if you are trying to make a confidence interval for a proportion, you will need to be in the “proportion” menu under “Bootstrap confidence intervals”.\nStatkey link: https://www.lock5stat.com/StatKey/index.html\n1. Atlanta Commute times\nWhat is the average commuting time for people who live and work in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area? It’s not feasible to contact all Atlanta residents, but the US Census Bureau regularly collects data from carefully selected samples of residents in many different areas. This data is from the American Housing Survey (AHS) which contains information about housing and living conditions for samples from certain metropolitan areas. These data represent a random sample of people who live in the Atlanta metropolitan area. They include only cases where the respondent worked somewhere other than home. Variables include the time (in minutes) and distance (in miles) that respondents typically traveled on their commute to work each day as well as age and sex.\n\nWe’re going to look at the Commute Time. In StatKey, choose “Confidence Interval for Mean, Median, StDev” and then “Atlanta Commute Time”. You should see the data distribution in the “Original Sample” graph. Describe the shape, center, and spread of the data distribution.\nWhat is the relevant parameter and the best point estimate?\nGenerate 1 bootstrap sample. You should see the sample under “Bootstrap sample”. How does n, mean, median, and st dev compare to the original sample?\nGenerate 1000 bootstrap samples and describe the shape, center, and spread of the bootstrap distribution. How does it compare to the data distribution? You should be able to explain why any discrepancies exist.\nConstruct a 95% confidence interval for the average commute time and interpret it in context\n\n2. Compassionate Rats\nIn a recent study, rats showed compassion that surprised scientists. Twenty-three of the 30 rats in the study freed another trapped rat in their cage, even when chocolate served as a distraction and even when the rats would then have to share the chocolate with their freed companion. Rats did not open the cage when it was empty or when there was a stuffed animal inside, only when a fellow rat was trapped. We wish to use the sample to estimate the proportion of rats that would show empathy in this way. The data are available in the dataset CompassionateRats on StatKey.\n\nGive the relevant parameter and its best point estimate\nDescribe how you could use slips of paper to create one bootstrap statistic. How many slips of paper do you need?\nUse StatKey to create a bootstrap distribution with 500 bootstrap samples. Describe the shape, center, and spread using appropriate quantities.\nUse StatKey to create a bootstrap distribution with 20,000 bootstrap samples. How does it compare to your distribution from (c)?\nUse the standard error to find and interpret a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of rats likely to show empathy.\n\n3. Do Teen Problems Differ Based on Income Level?\nA recent study found that anxiety/depression topped the list of problems teens see among their peers. The table below shows whether they consider anxiety/depression a major problem based on household income level. We are interested in estimating the difference in proportion who think it is a major problem between the two groups.\n\n\n\nIncome\nMajor Problem\nNot Major Problem\nTotal\n\n\n&lt;$75,000\n386\n150\n536\n\n\n&gt;$75,000\n258\n126\n384\n\n\nTotal\n644\n276\n920\n\n\n\n\nWhat proportion of teens in households with an income below 75,000 think it is a major problem? What about the proportion above 75,000? \nGive notation and the value of the relevant sample statistic. Give notation for the population parameter.\nUse StatKey to find the standard error for this statistic using a bootstrap distribution. (This data is called “Teen Anxiety Depression Problem (by Income)”)\nUse the standard error to find a 99% confidence interval for the difference in proportions.\n\n4. Atlanta Commute Times (again)\nA key reason for longer commute times is having to travel a further distance. We want to see how strong the (linear) relationship is between commute distance and commute time among Atlanta residents.\n\nWhat population parameter is of interest here? \nFind the correct StatKey menu and choose the dataset “Commute Atlanta (Time as a function of Distance)”. Describe the original sample and find the appropriate sample statistic. \nGenerate a bootstrap distribution and describe the shape, center, and spread. \nConstruct a 95% confidence interval and interpret it in context.",

Remake the table after reordering the categories.\n\npew$income &lt;- factor(pew$income, levels = c(\"0-30000\", \"30000-75000\",\n                                            \"75000-150000\", \"150000\"))\n\n5. Use esquisse or ggplot to make a stacked barplot of income and values.\n6. Your bar plot by default should show the counts of each combination. Copy and paste your bar plot code, and change geom_bar() to geom_bar(position = \"fill\"). Explain what this chunk of code did.\nStop Here and let Amanda know you’ve finished with the categorical EDA section\nA third variable in the dataset is age. The next few questions walk through how to do basic EDA for a quantitative variable.\n7. Create a histogram of the age variable using esquisse or ggplot\n8. In the empty code chunk below, run mean(pew$age) and median(pew$age). Now try mode(pew$age). What happened?\n9. Using your answers to the previous two questions, describe the distribution of age.",

Load in the data and check the “spreadsheet view”. How many cereals are in the sample?\n2. We’re going to try to predict carbs per gram (carbsgram) using calories per gram (calgram). Make a scatterplot and describe the relationship you find.\n3. Find a confidence interval for the slope and report your result in context. Some starter code is below (make sure to remove eval = FALSE!)\n4. Use the starter code below to find a 90% prediction interval for a new cereal with 3.5 calories per gram. Interpret your result in context.\n5. The code below creates a confidence interval and prediction interval for all predicted values. One is shown in blue and one is shown in orange. Which is which, and how can you tell?\n6. There is one point that falls outside of the prediction interval. Is this evidence that it is an outlier? Should we remove it?\n7. The code below makes residual plots for the cereal_lm model. (Remove eval = FALSE after you have created the model). Do you have any concerns about the LINE conditions?\n8. When we include plots on posters or in papers, we want to be mindful of how much space they take up but also make sure they are readable. One way that I like to do this is by putting multiple plots side-by-side using the patchwork package. Remove eval = FALSE and run the code below. Next, run p1+p2 in the console to make the plot show up in the viewer. Click on “export” and then “save as image”. Change the dimensions to be 1200 pixels long x 400 pixels tall and save your plot with an informative file name. In order to get the plot from the RStudio Server onto your own computer, go to the “Files” tab and click on the name of the image. This should bring up a high-quality image that you can copy and paste into a text editor or embed directly. Alternatively, you can check the box next to the image and click on “more –&gt; export” to download to your computer. Submit only this image file on gradescope (1 per group).",
